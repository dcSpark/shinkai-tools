# Name: Roll Safe Think About It

## General Context:
The "Roll Safe" meme features British actor Kayode Ewumi as the character Reece Simpson (aka Roll Safe) from the web series *Hood Documentary* (2016). The meme shows Ewumi pointing to his head with a knowing smile, symbolizing a "clever" or "smart" idea, but the humor lies in the fact that the ideas expressed are usually examples of flawed logic, poor decision-making, or overly simplistic solutions to complex problems[1][2][4][7]. It became widely popular on social media in early 2017, especially within Black Twitter, and quickly became associated with sarcastic or ironic advice that appears smart but is fundamentally misguided[1][2][7].

## Usage:
* Box 1: The first box generally contains a statement or premise, often phrased as a setup or observation.
* Box 2: The second box delivers the punchline, usually a flawed or ironically "clever" conclusion that plays on the premise from Box 1, frequently starting with "if" to create a conditional or sarcastic statement.

The meme format typically uses a top-bottom text layout where the image remains the same while captions vary to highlight absurd or faulty logic[6].

## Examples:
* "You can't be broke if you don't check your bank account."  
  (Implying ignorance of finances means no awareness of being broke)[2][4].
  
* "You can't get cheated on if you don't get into a relationship."  
  (Suggesting avoiding relationships altogether avoids infidelity)[2][4].

* "If you're already late, take your time â€” you can't be late twice."  
  (Mocking procrastination with faulty reasoning)[2].

* "Can't lose if you don't play."  
  (Highlighting the flawed logic of avoiding risks to avoid failure)[5].

* "Men are trash tweets have gone down 70%... well February is approaching."  
  (Playing on timing and behavior with a sarcastic twist)[2].

## Summary:
The "Roll Safe" meme originated from a comedic scene where the character Reece Simpson humorously implies he is being clever by tapping his head. Internet culture repurposed this image to mock obviously flawed or ironically "smart" thinking. The meme's core message is to highlight failures in common sense or critical thinking under the guise of clever advice. It satirizes the human tendency to rationalize poor decisions with seemingly logical but ultimately ridiculous justifications. The meme resonates as a humorous reflection on the absurdity of certain thought processes and has become a staple in internet humor for illustrating bad logic in a lighthearted, relatable way[1][4][5][7].
