# Name: C'mon, Do Something

## General Context:
The "C'mon, Do Something" meme originates from the webcomic *White Ninja* (2003), featuring a character poking a dead fish with a stick. The meme depicts this character repeatedly poking something inert or unresponsive, symbolizing impatience or frustration at a lack of action or response in various contexts. It became popular around 2015 and has spread widely on social media platforms like Reddit and Facebook to convey scenarios where people wish for some reaction or significant event to occur[1][6][8].

## Usage:
* Box 1: Usually contains a phrase or situation describing the object or topic being poked or the context of the meme (e.g., “When you run out of memes,” or the name/representation of something inactive).
* Box 2: Features a caption representing the character’s impatient or urging command, typically "C'mon, do something," or a variation like “C’mon, do a world war,” depending on the context of what action is desired.

The meme relies on the juxtaposition of the poked item (which can be anything from political parties, sports teams, social issues, to abstract concepts) and the demand for action coming from the White Ninja character poking it with a stick[1][6][8].

## Examples:
* A Reddit post captioned “When you run out of memes” showing the character poking various flags with the caption “C'mon, do a world war” to humorously express the desire for some dramatic event to happen[1][6].
* A meme showing the White Ninja poking the logo of *The Simpsons: Tapped Out* mobile game accompanied by the caption “C'mon... do something,” mocking the game’s inactivity or lack of updates[6].
* A sports-related meme where the character pokes NFL team logos, saying “C'mon, do something,” commenting on teams that are underperforming or stalled during the season[6].
* A darker humor example where emo teens are poked with “C’mon, do a s--cide,” illustrating a grim or edgy twist on the meme’s format[1].
* Political memes showing the character poking logos or symbols of political parties or countries, urging them to act or react, often with humorous or satirical intent[1][8].

## Summary:
The "C'mon, Do Something" meme encapsulates the universal feeling of impatience or frustration towards an unresponsive subject or situation. It humorously portrays the act of prodding or urging something seemingly inert to take action. Its strength lies in the simplicity of the original image—a character poking with a stick—and its flexibility, allowing users to insert a wide range of contexts, from memes about social phenomena and politics to sports and pop culture. The meme transmits a mix of sarcastic expectation and comedic desperation, making it a recurring format for expressing the desire for change, reaction, or notable events in various spheres of life[1][6][8].
