# Name: Gru's Plan

## General Context:
The "Gru's Plan" meme originates from a 2010 scene in the animated movie *Despicable Me*, where the protagonist Gru presents a villainous plan using a series of signboards. In the original scene, Gru confidently outlines his plan to steal the moon, but in the middle of the presentation, he discovers a drawing inserted by his foster daughters that embarrasses him, causing him to stop mid-explanation with a confused and dismayed expression. The meme format depicts this sequence of events across four panels and is used to humorously illustrate the moment when a plan goes awry or an unexpected flaw is discovered[3][6][8].

## Usage:
* Box 1: The initial step or part of Gru's plan, often confident and straightforward.
* Box 2: The continuation or second step of the plan, maintaining an optimistic or scheming tone.
* Box 3: The twist or unexpected flaw in the plan, usually the punchline or the part where the plan fails or backfires.
* Box 4: Gru’s reaction, showing surprise, confusion, or dismay upon realizing the plan’s flaw.

## Examples:
* A meme about a bad weather prediction where Gru confidently lays out a spring weather plan, but the unexpected bad weather is revealed in the third panel, and Gru looks dismayed in the fourth[3].
* A humorous take on daily life frustrations, such as planning to go to bed early but inevitably waking up late, with the meme highlighting the failure of the plan and Gru’s confused reaction[8].
* Economic commentary, such as businesses planning to increase prices for profit, only to realize that demand drops and profits may fall, with the meme format illustrating the flawed economic plan and Gru’s realization[8].
* Pop culture or political satire, mocking poorly thought-out decisions or schemes that unravel unexpectedly, using Gru's shifting expressions to emphasize the humor in failed logic or intentions[6].

## Summary:
The "Gru's Plan" meme captures the relatable experience of confidently devising a plan only to discover a critical flaw too late. Its four-panel format, featuring Gru's scheming demeanor turning into surprise and dismay, allows for versatile humor across themes—from simple daily mishaps to complex social and economic issues. The meme thrives on the universal feeling of plans unraveling unexpectedly and the comedic schadenfreude in witnessing that moment of realization. Its broad applicability, ease of customization, and the iconic character Gru make it a lasting and popular meme template in internet culture[3][6][8].
