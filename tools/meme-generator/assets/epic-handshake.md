# Name: Epic Handshake

## General Context:
The Epic Handshake meme originates from a memorable scene in the 1987 science fiction action film *Predator*, where two characters, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Dillon (Carl Weathers), greet each other with a powerful arm-wrestle handshake that quickly becomes a show of fraternal strength. The scene is iconic for its over-the-top display of masculinity and camaraderie, often viewed as campy and exaggerated. This handshake moment later inspired numerous parodies, remixes, and eventually a static image macro format widely used online to represent two parties coming together in agreement or shared strength over a particular topic[1][3][6].

## Usage:
The meme typically features three text boxes corresponding to the parts of the handshake image:
* Box 1 (left arm): Label for one party or group involved in the agreement or shared trait.
* Box 2 (right arm): Label for the other party or group involved.
* Box 3 (center, where the hands meet): The point of agreement or commonality that unites the two groups.

This format visually emphasizes a mutual understanding, alliance, or shared feature between otherwise differing or contrasting groups or ideas[1][3].

## Examples:
* The two arms labeled "Babies" and "Adults" meeting in agreement on "Suckin titties" humorously points out a common behavior shared by different ages[1].
* A variation featuring "Punks" and "Rappers" agreeing that "Calling the police is totally lame" shows how disparate subcultures might share an attitude despite differences[3].
* TikTok versions show two seemingly unrelated groups, such as "Lead singers" and "Dads getting ready to leave," shaking hands over a shared phrase "you guys ready to rock and roll?"[6].
* Another TikTok meme depicts "The person this got sent to" and "The person who sent you this" shaking hands as a humorous meta-commentary on meme sharing behavior[6].
* Star Wars themed variations depict characters like Han Solo and Darth Vader sharing an unlikely handshake, symbolizing unexpected agreement or alliance[2].

## Summary:
The Epic Handshake meme symbolizes unity and agreement between two entities that might typically be viewed as distinct or opposed. It communicates the idea that despite differences, there is a fundamental common ground that can be celebrated or highlighted. Originating from a hyper-masculine handshake scene in *Predator*, the meme has evolved into a versatile and frequently used format for illustrating humorous or insightful points of convergence between groups, ideas, or behaviors. It conveys strength in solidarity and the fun in finding unexpected commonalities, making it a popular and enduring internet meme with wide cultural resonance across platforms and communities[1][2][3][6].
