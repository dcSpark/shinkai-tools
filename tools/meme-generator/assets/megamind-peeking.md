# Name: Megamind peeking
## General Context:
Derived from a scene in *Megamind* (2010) where the titular character peers through a door peephole[2][3], this meme surged in late 2021–2022 as a template for sarcastic or patronizing remarks, often targeting perceived social inadequacies[1][7]. The "No Bitches?" variant became iconic for mocking individuals perceived as lacking romantic/sexual connections[5][7], though its usage has expanded to broader humor.

## Usage:
* **Box 1 (Top text):** A short, sarcastic question or statement (e.g., "No Bitches?")[2][7].
* **Box 2 (Bottom text):** Optional follow-up quip or emphasis (e.g., "Absolute Bitchless Behavior")[7].

## Examples:
* **"No Bitches?"** paired with Megamind’s peeking face to mock online arguments[7].
* **"No Maidens?"** (Elden Ring variant) for gaming-related jokes[7].
* **"No Glasses?"** when someone overlooks obvious details[6].
* **"No Social Credits?"** satirizing authoritarian critiques[^example].
* **"No Grass Touched?"** targeting chronically online behavior[^example].
* **"No Bitches?"** with "Proceeds to explain Minecraft lore" for niche fandom humor[6].

## Summary:
This meme uses Megamind’s peering expression to deliver humor through **short, biting sarcasm**, often targeting perceived inadequacies in social/romantic status, hobbies, or online behavior[5][7]. Its versatility allows adaptation to countless scenarios, combining nostalgia for the film with modern internet snark. The tone ranges from **lighthearted teasing** (e.g., "No Peaches?") to **acerbic commentary** (e.g., "Bitchless Behavior Detected")[6][7], universally conveying **patronizing judgment** with a comedic slant[1][3].
