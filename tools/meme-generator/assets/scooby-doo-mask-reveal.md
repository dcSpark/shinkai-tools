# Name: Scooby Doo Mask Reveal

## General Context:
The "Scooby Doo Mask Reveal" meme originates from the classic animated series *Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!* Specifically, it depicts a scene where a character dressed as a ghost is unmasked by the Scooby-Doo gang, revealing their true identity underneath. This moment of unmasking has been exploited as a meme template since 2017, often used to humorously reveal the "true identity" or hidden nature behind a person, thing, or concept that was previously disguised or misunderstood[1][3].

## Usage:
The meme features four distinct boxes or panels:

* **Box 1:** Shows the ghost or disguised figure (the "mask").
* **Box 2:** The character pulling off the mask.
* **Box 3:** The mask removed, revealing the "true identity" behind the disguise.
* **Box 4:** Usually the reaction or commentary panel that underscores the reveal.

This structure is used to illustrate a surprising or ironic unveiling, where the real cause, person, or idea is exposed after being hidden or misrepresented[1][3].

## Examples:
* A meme showing a popular brand logo as the masked figure, with the underlying identity revealed as a controversial company or entity.
* Depicting a social or political issue initially presented in one way (mask) but revealing the actual root cause or problematic actor behind it in the last panel.
* Referencing internet culture, such as revealing that a viral meme or trend is just a repackaging of an older meme.
* In business or work contexts, uncovering hidden practices or reasons behind failures, e.g., "Ignoring ROAS costs you revenue," using the meme to reveal the unseen underlying issue[1][6][8].

## Summary:
The Scooby Doo Mask Reveal meme leverages the iconic unmasking scene from *Scooby-Doo* to humorously and often sharply expose truths behind facades or misconceptions. It serves as a visual metaphor for unveiling hidden realities, whether about identity, motives, origins, or causes. The meme transmits the idea that beneath surface appearances lies a sometimes unexpected, ironic, or troublesome truth, inviting audiences to question what is presented at face value. This format is versatile and widely used for satire, critique, and comedic surprise across various cultural, social, and professional contexts[1][3][6].
