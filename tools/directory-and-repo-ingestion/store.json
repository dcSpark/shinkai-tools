  "description": "Ingests local directories or remote GitHub repositories and consolidates their contents into a single, structured text file, optimized for LLM analysis.\n\nKey Features:\n\n*   Dual Source Ingestion: Processes code from either a local file path or a direct GitHub repository URL.\n*   Structured Output: Generates a clean document containing a summary, a visual directory tree, and the full content of each included file.\n*   Granular Content Filtering: Provides robust control over what gets included, with sensible defaults for:\n    *   Ignoring common directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, etc.).\n    *   Ignoring binary and non-text file extensions (`.pyc`, `.png`, `.pdf`, etc.).\n    *   Including only recognized code-like files (`.py`, `.js`, `.yml`, `.md`, etc.).\n*   File Size Capping: Prevents overly large outputs by skipping the content of individual files that exceed a configurable size limit.\n*   Flexible Export Formats: Outputs the final document as either Markdown (`.md`) for rich formatting or Plain Text (`.txt`) for maximum compatibility.\n*   LLM-Ready Metrics: Reports the total token count (using `cl100k_base`) and final file size upon completion.\n\nNotes:\n\n*   Individual files larger than 100 KB are skipped by default to manage output size. This limit is configurable via the `max_file_size_kb` input.\n*   The tool recursively scans all subdirectories, building a complete map of the project structure while applying the filtering rules.\n*   The `git` command-line tool must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH to process GitHub URLs."
