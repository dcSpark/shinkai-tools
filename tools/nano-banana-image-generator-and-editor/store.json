  "name": "Nano Banana Image Generator and Editor",
  "description": "Generates or edits images using Google's Gemini models (Nano Banana/ Nano Banana Pro). Supports text-to-image and image-to-image/editing.\nRequires a Gemini API key.\n\nNotes:\n- Generates 1 image per API call.\n- Gemini 2.5 Flash (Nano Banana) is faster.\n- Gemini 3 Pro (Nano Banana Pro) uses a reasoning process (\"Thinking\") and supports higher resolutions.\n    \nBest Practices & Strategies:\n1. Be Hyper-Specific: Describe lighting, camera angles (e.g., \"low-angle perspective\"), and fine details.\n2. Context & Intent: Explain the purpose (e.g., \"Create a logo for a high-end brand\").\n3. Iteration: Use the conversational nature to refine (e.g., \"Make lighting warmer\").\n4. Step-by-Step: For complex scenes, break instructions into steps (Background -> Foreground -> Subject).\n5. Semantic Negative Prompts: Describe what you want positively (e.g., \"empty street\") rather than \"no cars\".\n6. Photorealism: Use terms like \"85mm lens\", \"bokeh\", \"golden hour\", \"studio-lit\".\n7. Text Rendering: Specify font style and placement clearly. Use 'pro' model for best text results.\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana):\n- Works best with up to 3 images as input.\n\nGemini 3 Pro Image Preview (Nano Banana Pro):\n- Supports up to 14 images in total.\n- Up to 6 images of objects with high-fidelity.\n- Up to 5 images of humans to maintain character consistency.\n\n"
