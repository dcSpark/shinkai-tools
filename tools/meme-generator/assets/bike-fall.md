# Name: Bike Fall
## General Context:
The "Bike Fall" meme typically involves a humorous depiction of someone experiencing a cycling accident. It often features a three-panel comic strip where the first panel shows a person riding a bicycle, the second panel depicts the person losing control, and the third panel shows the person having fallen off the bike. The meme can be used to illustrate unexpected failures or accidents in various contexts, making it relatable and often used to express frustration or irony.

## Usage:
* **Box 1**: Usually sets the scene or establishes the expectation. In a typical bike fall meme, this might show someone starting a journey or engaging in an activity with confidence.
* **Box 2**: The turning point where the expectation is subverted, often showing a mishap or an unexpected event, like losing balance or another form of failure leading up to the fall.
* **Box 3**: Concludes with the aftermath or the result of the failure, like someone lying on the ground or dealing with the consequences of their actions.

## Examples:
* **Example 1**: Using the meme to depict a story of overconfidence leading to failure. For instance, Box 1 could show someone saying "I've got this," Box 2 could depict them getting into trouble (like riding into a puddle), and Box 3 shows them falling off the bike.
* **Example 2**: Applying it to a non-cycling scenario, such as a job interview. Box 1 could show someone confidently answering questions, Box 2 might show them making a critical error, and Box 3 could depict them getting rejected.
* **Example 3**: Using it to poke fun at everyday situations, like someone trying to cook a meal and ending up with a kitchen disaster. Each panel progresses from confidence to chaos.

## Summary:
