# Name: Boardroom Meeting Suggestion  
## General Context:  
The meme originated from a 2012 webcomic titled "Outlook Oust" on Hejibits, depicting a Nintendo executive discussing Wii U features[1][4]. It gained popularity on 4chan, Reddit, and Facebook in 2013 for satirizing corporate-executive vs. consumer mindset gaps[1][4]. The format shows a boss dismissing a "voice of reason" employee who suggests practical (but unpopular-with-management) solutions[3][5].  

## Usage:  
* **Box 1 (Boss' question):** "How do we improve [product/service]?" or a specific problem statement  
* **Box 2 (Employee 1):** Corporate-safe answer (e.g., "More ads")  
* **Box 3 (Employee 2):** Similar safe/obvious suggestion (e.g., "Rebrand it")  
* **Box 4 (Employee 3):** Direct consumer-focused solution that gets them ejected (e.g., "Make it actually work")  

## Examples:  
* **Gaming:**  
  * Q: "How do we fix this buggy game?"  
  * A1: "Release exclusive DLC"  
  * A2: "Add loot boxes"  
  * A3: "Delay release to fix it properly" → *YEET*[4][5]  
* **Tech:**  
  * Q: "How do we boost smartphone sales?"  
  * A1: "Remove chargers"  
  * A2: "Make them thinner"  
  * A3: "Include headphone jacks" → *WINDOW SMASH*[5]  
* **Pop Culture:**  
  * Q: "How do we improve the Star Wars prequels?"  
  * A1: "More Jar Jar"  
  * A2: "Add podracing DLC"  
  * A3: "Hire better writers" → *DEFENESTRATION*[4]  

## Summary:  
This meme critiques institutional resistance to consumer-centric problem solving. It humorously portrays how organizations often prioritize profit-driven or tone-deaf solutions over addressing core issues. The format resonates across industries, serving as shorthand for frustration with corporate bureaucracy and the dismissal of practical ideas in favor of superficial fixes[4][5][7].
