# Name: Flex Tape

## General Context:
The Flex Tape meme originates from a 2017 television commercial for Flex Tape, a product advertised by spokesperson Phil Swift. In the commercial, Phil Swift demonstrates the power of the tape by slapping it onto a large, leaking water tank, effectively stopping the leak. The exaggerated demonstration and Phil Swift’s enthusiastic delivery made the commercial viral, leading to its popularity as a meme source. The meme is widely used to humorously depict a quick, bold, or absurd "fix" to a much bigger problem, often implying that the solution is either oversimplified or comically insufficient[1][5][6].

## Usage:
* Box 1: Description or depiction of a serious or large problem.
* Box 2: An image or text that shows the application of "Flex Tape" or a metaphorical quick fix.
* Box 3: The result after applying the "Flex Tape," often showing the problem "fixed" or the tape failing, depending on the humorous intent.

This structure plays on the original commercial's three-part flow: the problem (leak), the solution (slapping tape), and the result (leak stopped).

## Examples:
* Example 1: The first box could show a massive software bug or system crash, the second box shows Phil Swift slapping Flex Tape labeled “Quick Patch,” and the third box shows the system running again, humorously suggesting the patch fixed a complex issue.
* Example 2: The first box displays a broken relationship or friendship, the second box shows Flex Tape labeled “One Apology Text,” and the third box shows the relationship hilariously "fixed."
* Example 3: The first box shows a huge financial problem, the second box shows Flex Tape labeled “Lottery Ticket,” and the third box shows the financial issue humorously "resolved."
* Example 4: Depicting a massive leak or problem in a physical object (like a car or a boat) in the first box, the second box shows Flex Tape slapped on it, and the third box either shows it fixed or ironically still leaking, poking fun at the tape’s unrealistic effectiveness.

## Summary:
The Flex Tape meme is a satirical commentary on quick fixes to complex or significant problems. It leverages the exaggerated demonstration from the Flex Tape commercial, where a simple slap of tape supposedly repairs a massive leak. The meme typically uses a three-panel format showing the problem, the absurdly simple solution, and the outcome. It transmits humor around the idea of slapdash or overconfident solutions, often highlighting how inadequate or ridiculous such fixes can be in real life. The meme also implicitly mocks overly enthusiastic advertising and the desire for easy solutions to difficult problems[1][3][5].
