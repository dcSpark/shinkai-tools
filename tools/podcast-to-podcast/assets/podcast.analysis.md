## How to Use This Structure
1. **Prompt with Sections**  
   Provide each section’s bullet points to your LLM along with relevant snippets or transcripts from the podcast. This helps the model zero in on crucial details.

2. **Customize for Length & Detail**  
   Indicate desired summary length (e.g., 100 words per section) or technical depth (casual listener vs. industry expert).

3. **Iterative Refinement**  
   Generate initial summaries, then refine based on feedback or new insights. You can emphasize certain sections (e.g., “Focus more on the guest’s background” or “Expand on supporting data”).

4. **Maintain Clarity & Tone**  
   Guide the LLM on the desired style (informal vs. professional, jargon-free vs. technical). Ensure the end result is informative and easy to follow.

Use this structure for any podcast—business, technology, culture, entertainment—to systematically capture the essence of each episode and present it in a concise, reader-friendly format.
