# Name: Tuxedo Winnie the Pooh
## General Context:
The **Tuxedo Winnie the Pooh** meme, also known as "A Fellow Man of Culture," originated from an image of Winnie the Pooh wearing a tuxedo and reclining in an armchair. Initially, it circulated as a reaction image on 4chan before gaining popularity on Reddit in March 2019. The meme is derived from a scene where Pooh appears bored or disinterested, often falling asleep, in a meeting at Rabbit's house from the 1974 Disney featurette *Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too*[1][2].

## Usage:
- **Box 1**: Typically features the original Winnie the Pooh in his classic attire, often with a cheerful or bored expression, symbolizing the "before" state or something deemed ordinary.
- **Box 2**: Depicts Winnie the Pooh in a tuxedo, usually with a more sophisticated or smug expression, representing the "after" state or an elevated version of something[4].

## Examples:
- **Example 1**: 
  - Box 1: "Watching TV on a regular day."
  - Box 2: "Watching Shakespearean plays."
- **Example 2**: 
  - Box 1: "Drinking regular coffee."
  - Box 2: "Enjoying artisanal coffee."
- **Example 3**: 
  - Box 1: "Eating at a fast-food joint."
  - Box 2: "Dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant."
- **Example 4**:

  - Box 2: "Traveling by private jet."

## Summary:
The **Tuxedo Winnie the Pooh** meme is used to humorously contrast two states of something: one ordinary or mundane, and the other elevated or sophisticated. It often implies that one version is superior or more refined than the other. When accompanied by the phrase "A Fellow Man of Culture," it can be used sarcastically to commend or mock something seen as cultured or pretentious. The meme plays on the juxtaposition of appearances and behaviors, emphasizing the transformation from casual to refined or sophisticated[5][2].
