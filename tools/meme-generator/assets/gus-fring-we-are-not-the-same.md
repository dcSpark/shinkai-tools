# Name: Gus Fring "We Are Not The Same"

## General Context:
The "Gus Fring we are not the same" meme originates from the character Gustavo "Gus" Fring, played by Giancarlo Esposito in the TV series *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul*. The meme template typically uses an image of Gus with a serious, composed expression and highlights a comparison between two subjects or entities, emphasizing a stark distinction between them. It is often used to humorously underline differences in opinions, qualities, or behaviors by stating "we are not the same," implying superiority or a notable contrast.

## Usage:
The meme contains three text boxes, commonly arranged in the following way:

* Box 1 (Top box): The first subject or a statement representing one side or perspective.
* Box 2 (Middle box): The contrasting subject or statement.
* Box 3 (Bottom box): The phrase "We are not the same," delivered as a concluding remark emphasizing the contrast.

This structure supports a comparison where the two preceding boxes describe two different things, and the bottom box sums up the difference with Gus Fring asserting the separation.

## Examples:
* Example 1:  
  * Box 1: "People who work hard for their money"  
  * Box 2: "People who complain about working hard"  
  * Box 3: "We are not the same"

* Example 2:  
  * Box 1: "Cats that drink water from their bowl"  
  * Box 2: "Cats that drink water from the faucet"  
  * Box 3: "We are not the same"

* Example 3:  
  * Box 1: "Using Windows for gaming"  
  * Box 2: "Using Mac for gaming"  
  * Box 3: "We are not the same"

* Example 4:  
  * Box 1: "Waking up early and being productive"  
  * Box 2: "Sleeping in until noon"  
  * Box 3: "We are not the same"

## Summary:
The "Gus Fring we are not the same" meme leverages the serious and composed demeanor of Gus Fring to emphasize differences between two entities or ideas.
