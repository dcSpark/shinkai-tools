# Name: Sleeping Shaq

## General Context:
"Sleeping Shaq" is a popular multi-pane exploitable meme featuring retired NBA star Shaquille O'Neal in a sequence of images that depict him sleeping or being asleep in one panel and awake or alert in another. This meme format is often used to illustrate indifference or ignorance toward one thing (while "sleeping") and excitement, awareness, or concern about a contrasting or more significant matter (upon "waking up"). The meme has strong parallels to the "Expanding Brain" meme series, where increasing levels of interest or enlightenment are humorously portrayed[1][2].

The original photo of Shaq sleeping was taken during the NBA Media Day in 2008 and later popularized online through various social media platforms starting notably in 2016 by pages like "Thot Patrol" on Facebook. Since then, it has become an evergreen meme template across Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, and image-sharing sites as well as messaging platforms like Discord and WhatsApp[1][2][4].

## Usage:
* Box 1 (top panel): Shaquille O'Neal depicted as sleeping or indifferent, typically paired with text that implies ignoring, not caring, or being unaware of a certain topic or situation.
* Box 2 (bottom panel): Shaquille O'Neal shown awake, alert, or reacting, paired with text describing something that finally grabs his attention or that he finds much more important or worthy of concern.

This two-panel contrast humorously highlights selective attention, double standards, or differing levels of enthusiasm about different subjects[1][5].

## Examples:
* Example 1:  
Box 1: "Me when people talk about regular video games"  
Box 2: "Me waking up when someone mentions cheat codes or mods"

* Example 2:  
Box 1: "Ignoring math homework assignments"  
Box 2: "Wide awake for 'pop quiz tomorrow'"

* Example 3:  
Box 1: "Not caring about minor NBA trades"  
Box 2: "Waking up for trade rumors involving Shaquille O'Neal"

* Example 4:  
Box 1: "Me sleeping when my phone buzzes during a boring meeting"  
Box 2: "Me waking up when someone mentions lunch plans"

* Example 5:  
Box 1: "No reaction to usual internet drama"  
Box 2: "Fully awake for memes about Shaq himself"

These examples show how the meme is adapted to widely relatable contexts about attention, priorities, preference, and ironic disinterest[1][2][5].

## Summary:
The "Sleeping Shaq" meme is a visual metaphor for selective interest or awareness, using the familiar and humorously exaggerated image of Shaquille O'Neal sleeping and then suddenly waking up. It conveys how people often "sleep on" or ignore certain topics but become instantly attentive or reactive when something more personally significant or exciting occurs. This meme underscores human nature's tendency to prioritize what feels relevant or urgent while dismissing the mundane.

Its enduring popularity stems from Shaq's recognizable figure, the simplicity and flexibility of the two-panel format, and the universal theme of contrasting attention states. The meme not only entertains but also invites creative commentary on daily life, social issues, fandom, and cultural phenomena through a humorous lens. Shaquille O'Neal himself has acknowledged and embraced meme culture, further cementing this memeâ€™s place in internet history as an iconic and evergreen format[1][2][4].
