# Name: Grant Gustin Next To Oliver Queen's Grave

## General Context:
This meme is based on a behind-the-scenes photo from the CW Arrowverse shows, featuring Grant Gustin (who plays Barry Allen/The Flash) posing next to the grave of Oliver Queen (The Green Arrow) while flashing a peace sign with a smug or celebratory expression. The original picture comes from the filming of the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover event and surfaced publicly in early 2020.

The meme typically symbolizes celebrating the death or end of someone or something disliked or seen as a rival. It is frequently used to depict gloating over the downfall, failure, or death of a competitor, character, concept, or company. It can also represent a fanbase's positive reaction to a disliked character's demise or the end of an era. Sometimes, the meme is adapted for someone posing next to their own grave for ironic or humorous effect[1][2][3].

## Usage:
* Box 1 (usually the tombstone or grave): Text representing the person, thing, or concept that "died," failed, or was defeated.
* Box 2 (usually text over Grant Gustin or near him): Text representing the person, thing, or concept celebrating the demise or end of Box 1.

Because the original image has two main caption areas (the tombstone and the figure beside it), these are the typical spots to place contrasting or related labels to convey the meme’s meaning.

## Examples:
* Internet Browsers:
  - Tombstone: Internet Explorer
  - Grant Gustin: Google Chrome

* Streaming platforms or shows:
  - Tombstone: A canceled TV show
  - Grant Gustin: The show's rival or the fanbase that disliked the canceled show
* Personal or career plans during COVID-19:
  - Tombstone: "Any personal or career plans I had made for 2020"
  - Grant Gustin: The person celebrating the "death" of those plans due to the pandemic

Other variants include:
- Loki-themed memes where both the grave and Grant Gustin have Loki written.
- Fandom-specific memes where characters or icons relevant to that fandom replace the original figures.
- Memes about companies, technologies, or cultural phenomena that are falling out of favor[1][2][3][4][6].

## Summary:
The "Grant Gustin Next To Oliver Queen's Grave" meme originates from a candid, behind-the-scenes photo taken during the filming of the Arrowverse crossover, where Grant Gustin poses with a peace sign next to the grave of Oliver Queen. It has since become a popular meme template used to express glee or satisfaction over the metaphorical or literal "death" or downfall of an entity disliked by the meme creator.

The core meaning of the meme is celebrating the end or defeat of an adversary or competitor, often laced with humor or irony. It conveys a triumphant or mocking tone and is versatile, applicable to cultural moments, fandom rivalries, corporate failures, or personal setbacks. The meme resonates with audiences because it visually captures the juxtaposition of loss (the grave) with a nonchalant or mocking celebration (Grant Gustin’s pose), making it a powerful and humorous way to express schadenfreude or relief[1][2][3][4].

Stephen Amell, who played Oliver Queen, has commented on the meme's popularity, showing it has a lasting impact in pop culture, especially within the fan communities surrounding these shows[4].
