Tools will fail if you refer to them in any other manner. If you dont have the appropiate UUID invoke a tool like get workflow states or organization info. Inputs passed like this are wrong `Inputs: {\"id\":\"08a8faa0-92b1-4cd9-8215-a6943ab64604\",\"status\":\"closed\"}`. This is because the status is passed as a string and not by its UUID, that must be obtained by fetching the workflow states first.\n<IMPORTANT>\n",
