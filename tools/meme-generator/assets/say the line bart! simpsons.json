The "Say the line, Bart!" meme originates from the popular animated television show *The Simpsons*. It is often referenced in conjunction with a scene in which the character Bart Simpson is prompted by another character to repeat a well-known catchphrase or line, typically with a humorous or exaggerated emphasis. This scene captures the essence of Bart’s character, who is often depicted as mischievous and playful.

The meme has since evolved, and it is frequently used in various contexts across social media platforms. It exemplifies a call-and-response dynamic, where one party encourages another to articulate a familiar phrase. This may not only humorously reference Bart’s antics but can also lend itself to broader applications, such as in discussions about predictability in behavior or the cultural pervasiveness of certain quotes.

As for specific applications, users often employ the phrase in memes where someone is expected to say something predictable or well-known, poking fun at either the expectation or the repetition of clichés within various contexts.
