# Name: Trump Bill Signing

## General Context:
The "Trump Bill Signing" meme features a famous image of former U.S. President Donald Trump at a bill signing ceremony, holding up executive orders or documents, often depicted with blank or redacted papers. This image is commonly used as a template to create satirical or humorous memes about presidential decisions, policies, or proclamations. The meme originated from footage and photos of Trump signing executive orders in early 2017, which quickly became fodder for internet humor, especially after users replaced the documents with absurd, ironic, or exaggerated claims or rules[2][3].

## Usage:
* **Box 1 (Top Caption):** Typically used to display the subject or theme of the "bill" or "order" that Trump is supposedly signing. This might be a humorous or ironic statement, a fake law, or a ridiculous executive order.
* **Box 2 (Bottom Caption):** Usually used to elaborate or add a punchline related to the top caption, reinforcing the joke or satire. Sometimes this box clarifies the absurdity or the context of what the bill entails.

The meme format leverages the visual of Trump proudly holding up a document as if endorsing something official, making it perfect for exaggeration and satire.

## Examples:
* "Anime is now illegal" / "All episodes must be destroyed" — a common humorous example playing on absurd authoritarian orders[3].
* "Pokemon is banned" / "No more Pikachu allowed" — a playful meme about banning popular culture items[3].
* "Andrews Jackson is now illegal" / "Historical figures rewritten" — poking fun at revisionist history or political correctness[8].
* "Don't be mad at lazy people;" / "They just found a loophole" — using the format to make social commentary or jokes about laziness or social behavior[8].
* "Party parrot is now the national bird" / "All other birds retired" — meme creators have used this template to mock or joke about trivial or absurd official decrees[4].

## Summary:
The "Trump Bill Signing" meme is a visual meme template leveraging an iconic photo of Donald Trump at a bill signing event, repurposed for satirical and humorous commentary. It typically presents fictional or exaggerated executive orders or laws, playing off the serious context of presidential power to make jokes about politics, culture, or social issues. The meme transmits irony by juxtaposing Trump's formal gesture with absurd or trivial "legislation," reflecting internet culture's knack for turning political moments into widely shared humor. Its flexibility and recognizability make it popular for commentary, parody, and lighthearted critique of political and social topics[2][3][8].
