# Name: Always Has Been (Wait, It's All Ohio?)
## General Context:
Originating from a 2016 Reddit post depicting two astronauts discussing a flat Earth[1], the meme evolved into its current format by 2018â€“2019, gaining mainstream traction with the "Ohio" variation[1][4]. It humorously explores absurd revelations, often satirizing conspiracy theories or unexpected truths[3][7].

## Usage:
* **Box 1:** Astronaut observing Earth, making a shocked realization (e.g., "Wait, it's all Ohio?")[1][4].
* **Box 2:** Second astronaut pointing a gun, asserting the revealed truth with "Always has been"[3][5].

## Examples:
* **Ohio Supremacy:** "Wait, it's all Ohio?" / "Always has been"[1][7].  
* **Apex Legends Twist:** Game holospray adds a third astronaut to mock "third-party" fights in battle royales[5].  
* **Flat Earth Parody:** Original concept mocking conspiracy theories[1][2].  
* **Cultural Jabs:** "Wait, it's all [political party/country/trend]?" used for ironic exaggeration[4][6].  
* **Surreal Humor:** "Wait, it's all Baja Blast?" / "Always has been" for random product humor[5].

## Summary:
The meme critiques human tendencies to overlook obvious truths or fabricate absurd narratives. Its minimalist setup allows infinite adaptability, making it a vehicle for satire, surreal humor, and cultural commentary. The gun-toting astronaut symbolizes the blunt enforcement of these "revealed" truths, often highlighting societal ironies or online inside jokes[1][3][5].
