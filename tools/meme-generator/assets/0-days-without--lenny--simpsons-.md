# Name: 0 Days Without (Lenny, Simpsons)

## General Context:
The "0 Days Without (Lenny, Simpsons)" meme is based on a signboard style image featuring the character Lenny Leonard from *The Simpsons*. The format shows a counter that ostensibly tracks the number of days since a particular event or behavior last occurred, frequently set to zero, implying the event just happened again or never stopped happening. This style of meme is a variant of the broader "Days Since Last X" meme format, which humorously or sarcastically comments on repeated or ongoing situations by showing zero days have elapsed since the last incident[1][6].

## Usage:
* Box 1: The top text or sign line stating the number of days since the last occurrence of an event, often "0 days without..."
* Box 2: The second text box typically names the event, behavior, or situation that supposedly just happened again, or has been continuous (e.g., "nonsense," "degenerate nonsense," or other humorous or topical issues)[1][4].

## Examples:
* "0 days without nonsense" — used to highlight a recurring ridiculous or absurd situation, often related to internet culture or current events[2].
* "0 days without degenerate nonsense" — emphasizing ongoing chaotic or absurd behavior in a sarcastic or humorous way[4].
* Customized variants with different events or "offenses" that are humorously repeated or never cease, such as political gaffes, celebrity scandals, or daily annoyances[1].
* Sometimes this format is used to ironically comment on serious issues by showing the counter always at zero, meaning the problem is constant and unresolved, similar in style to the "Days Since Last X" meme about accidents or catastrophes[6].

## Summary:
The "0 Days Without (Lenny, Simpsons)" meme is a humorous, ironic template used to point out the continual recurrence of an event, often negative, silly, or absurd. By showing a "0 days" counter, it conveys that the event just happened or never stopped happening, effectively mocking the persistence or inevitability of the situation. Its roots tie into a broader meme culture of tracking time since incidents, originally used in contexts like workplace safety or tragic events, but here applied humorously to everyday absurdities. The meme transmits a sense of ongoing frustration or resigned humor about repetitive behaviors or events in society or online culture, often using the recognizable Simpsons character Lenny to add comedic familiarity[1][6].
