# Name: Bernie Sanders Once Again Asking

## General Context:
This meme originates from a fundraising video posted by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in December 2019, where he says, "I am once again asking for your financial support" while dressed warmly and seated. The phrase quickly became a viral image macro in early 2020, widely used on social media platforms like Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram. The meme's format humorously repurposes Sanders’ polite and earnest request for donations to comment on various situations where someone is repeatedly asking for help, money, favors, or attention — often in a humorous or exaggerated way. It captures the feeling of persistent or resigned appeals and has been embraced broadly beyond political contexts[1][4][5].

## Usage:
* Box 1: Typically contains the setup or context of what someone is repeatedly asking for or needing.
* Box 2: Contains the punchline or elaboration on what is being asked for "once again," often exaggerating or twisting the original context into relatable or absurd scenarios.

The meme usually pairs the image of Bernie Sanders from the video with the text mimicking the phrasing "I am once again asking for..." followed by various requests or complaints.

## Examples:
* Example 1: A college student complaining about Zoom breakout rooms might write:  
  Box 1: "I am once again asking..."  
  Box 2: "...for you to stop making us do breakout rooms."  
* Example 2: Someone joking about money troubles might say:  
  Box 1: "I am once again asking..."  
  Box 2: "...for my parents to pay my rent."  
* Example 3: A social commentary meme might use it to express frustration with ongoing societal issues:  
  Box 1: "I am once again asking..."  
  Box 2: "...for systemic change."  
* Example 4: In a humorous or absurd context:  
  Box 1: "I am once again asking..."  
  Box 2: "...for someone to explain TikTok to me."  

These variations use the meme to express persistent needs, repeated annoyances, or ongoing demands, often with a self-deprecating or sarcastic tone[1][4][5].
