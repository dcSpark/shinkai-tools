# Name: Leonardo DiCaprio Cheers

## General Context:
The "Leonardo DiCaprio Cheers" meme originates from a scene in the 2013 film *The Great Gatsby*, where Leonardo DiCaprio, playing Jay Gatsby, raises a champagne glass and smiles in a toast. This particular image has been widely used as a reaction meme to convey agreement, praise, congratulations, or sometimes ironic cheers[1][2]. 

## Usage:
* Box 1: Typically features the setup or reason for the toast, such as a scenario, statement, or achievement.
* Box 2: Usually contains the punchline, reaction, or an extension of the toast, often humorous or celebratory.

The meme effectively uses two text boxes to build context and then deliver a relatable or ironic message accompanying the visual of DiCaprio’s toast.

## Examples:
* "A glass for people celebrating their birthdays today" / "Cheers to surviving another year"[2]
* "Thank you student loans, for helping me get through college" / "Here's to hoping the debt’s worth it"[6]
* "A glass for those who raise a glass for those who now raise a glass" — a recursive toast meme poking fun at endless cheering[2]
* "When you finally finish your work early" / "Cheers to productivity!" (used genuinely)
* "When your friend cancels plans last minute" / "Cheers to unexpected free time!" (ironic use)

## Summary:
The Leonardo DiCaprio Cheers meme leverages a classy and iconic moment from *The Great Gatsby* to create a versatile image perfect for expressing congratulations, acknowledgment, and camaraderie. Its widespread appeal comes from DiCaprio’s satisfied and cordial expression paired with a celebratory toast, which can be adapted to both sincere and ironic contexts. The meme transmits a sense of shared recognition, sometimes tinged with humor or sarcasm, making it a popular choice to highlight achievements, social bonds, or communal sentiments online[1][2][4].
