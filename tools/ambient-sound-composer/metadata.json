  "name": "Ambient Sound Composer",
  "description": "This tool functions as a personal soundscape generator, creating single ambient audio experiences tailored to your specific prompts. By leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), it intelligently selects and mixes sounds from a library to produce a unique MP3 file that matches the mood or environment you describe.\n\n(Note: To build longer evolving sound journeys, use the tool 'ambient sound journey composer', which uses the present tool under the hood.)\n\n### How to Use the Tool:\n\nThis tool offers a straightforward, step-by-step process for creating your ideal ambient soundscape:\n\n1.  **Download the Sound Library**: Before you can generate any soundscapes, you must first download the necessary audio assets. To do this, simply run the tool with the `download_assets` option set to `True`. This will fetch the default sound library from a GitHub repository and store it on your local machine. The tool supports .mp3 and .wav sound files.\n\n2.  **Customize with Your Own Sounds (Optional)**: You have the creative freedom to expand the sound library. To add your own audio, just place any MP3 or WAV files into the designated `assets_folder`. You can also create subfolders to organize your sounds by category. For best results, use only a 2 level depth (categories, subcategories, no more). The tool will automatically detect and integrate these new files, making them available for your soundscapes.\n\n3.  **Generate Your Soundscape**: Once your sound library is ready, you can start creating. Provide a descriptive `prompt` detailing the type of ambient sound you want (e.g., \"a peaceful forest with a gentle stream and distant birds\"). The tool will then generate a custom MP3 file based on your description.\n\n4.  **Explore Your Sound Options (Optional)**: If you're unsure what sounds are available or want to get ideas for your prompts, you can set the `show_available_sounds` option to `True`. This will provide a complete list of all the sounds in your library, including any you've added yourself, without generating an audio file.",
