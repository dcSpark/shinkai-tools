# Name: Woman Yelling at a Cat

## General Context:
The "Woman Yelling at a Cat" meme combines two juxtaposed images: on the left, a screenshot from *The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills* featuring Taylor Armstrong tearfully yelling while being restrained by Kyle Richards; on the right, a picture of a confused-looking cat named Smudge sitting behind a dinner plate with salad. The meme originated from these two unrelated sources but was first combined in May 2019 on Twitter. The woman’s image comes from a heated, emotional scene in a reality TV show involving personal trauma, while the cat image was originally a Tumblr post from 2018 of Smudge, an Ottawa-based cat, reacting to salad at a dinner table in a bemused way[2][4][5]. The meme format became widely popular online because of the comedic contrast between the intense human emotion and the cat's indifferent or confused expression.

## Usage:
* Box 1 (left side): The image of the woman (Taylor Armstrong) yelling and crying, often representing an angry or frustrated person or character.
* Box 2 (right side): The image of the cat (Smudge) sitting at the dinner table looking confused or unimpressed, typically symbolizing a calm, indifferent, or sarcastic response.

## Examples:
* Example 1: Person A yelling an absurd or emotional complaint (Box 1), while Person B (represented by the cat) responds with calm disbelief or ignores the complaint (Box 2).
* Example 2: Used to highlight misunderstandings or overreactions, such as one side being overly dramatic and the other side reacting with dismissive humor.
* Example 3: Applied in social or political commentary, where the woman yelling symbolizes outrage and the cat's expression pokes fun at the overblown reaction.
* Example 4: In gaming culture, the meme is adapted to show a player angrily blaming a game mechanic or opponent (woman yelling) while the cat represents the game’s indifferent system or the opposing player’s calm reaction[7].
* Example 5: Humorous takes where the woman yells something nonsensical or unrelated, and the cat giving a deadpan or unimpressed look in response.

## Summary:
The "Woman Yelling at a Cat" meme encapsulates a humorous dichotomy between intense human emotion and detached, unimpressed reaction. It highlights the absurdity of some overreactions by contrasting emotional yelling with a cat’s indifferent stare. Originally drawn from a dramatic and personal scene involving Taylor Armstrong from *The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills* and paired with an unrelated but expressive cat photo, the meme became an internet sensation by blending real human drama with lighthearted animal humor. It symbolizes conflicts where one party is upset or ranting while the other is nonplussed, making it widely adaptable for social commentary, personal expression, and absurdist humor[2][4][5]. Despite its fun surface, the meme’s origin has a darker context related to domestic abuse, which adds layers of irony to its widespread use[1][5].
