# Name: They Don't Know / I Wish I Was At Home
## General Context:  
Originating in 2009 as a Wojak ("Feels Guy") meme[1], this format gained mainstream traction in 2020 as a vehicle for expressing social anxiety, niche online achievements, and the disconnect between digital personas and real-world interactions[5]. The core image depicts a lone Wojak at a party wishing they were home, often paired with self-deprecating humor about unrecognized skills or status[2].

## Usage:  
* **Box 1:** Sets the scene - typically "They don't know..." or "No one realizes..."  
* **Box 2:** Specifies the hidden truth - "...I'm mildly popular on left Twitter" / "...I speedrun Mario 64"  

## Examples:  
* **Niche fandom:** "They don't know I have 50k followers on my obscure anime meme page"[4]  
* **Gaming culture:** "They don't know I'm ranked top 500 in Overwatch"[6]  
* **IRL social dynamics:** "They don't know I'm mentally replaying yesterday's awkward conversation"[2]  
* **Creative superiority:** "They don't know I've written 100k words of unpublished fanfiction"[5]  

## Summary:  
This meme encapsulates the tension between online/offline identities, particularly among digitally-native communities. It humorously validates:  
1. **Social alienation** through its "outsider at the party" imagery[1]  
2. **Validation-seeking** for niche online accomplishments[5]  
3. **Cognitive dissonance** between perceived digital importance and real-world anonymity[2]  
While often self-mocking, it serves as both coping mechanism and cultural commentary on internet-era socialization[4].
