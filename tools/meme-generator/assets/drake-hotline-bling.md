# Name: Drake Hotline Bling

## General Context:
The "Drake Hotline Bling" meme originates from the 2015 music video for Drake's hit single "Hotline Bling." The video features Drake dancing in front of colorful, minimalistic backgrounds with distinctive and exaggerated dance moves. A particular format from the video gained massive popularity: two images of Drake from the video placed side-by-side, with the first showing him expressing dislike or rejection, and the second showing him approving or liking something else. This simple, visual "yes/no" or "dislike/like" dichotomy made it an ideal meme format for contrasting preferences or opinions[2][4][6].

## Usage:
* Box 1 (Top box or left panel): A depiction of Drake showing distaste, rejection, or dislike toward something.
* Box 2 (Bottom box or right panel): A depiction of Drake showing pleasure, approval, or liking for something else.

This two-panel layout is used to humorously express preferences, choices, or attitudes by contrasting an undesired item or idea with a preferred one[2][4].

## Examples:
* Example 1:  
Box 1: "Doing homework" (Drake rejecting)  
Box 2: "Playing video games" (Drake approving)  

* Example 2:  
Box 1: "Old album covers" (Drake rejecting)  
Box 2: "New album cover" (Drake approving)  

* Example 3:  
Box 1: "Paying for software" (Drake rejecting)  
Box 2: "Using free alternatives" (Drake approving)  

* Example 4:  
Box 1: "Going outside" (Drake rejecting)  
Box 2: "Staying home and binge-watching TV" (Drake approving)  

* Example 5:  
Box 1: "Working late" (Drake rejecting)  
Box 2: "Early weekend plans" (Drake approving)  

Beyond the basic preference format, the meme has also been adapted into variations such as "Drakeposting," reaction images on forums, and even mash-ups involving pop culture elements like cats or sci-fi references[4][6].

## Summary:
The "Drake Hotline Bling" meme is a widely recognized internet reaction format derived from Drake's 2015 music video where his dance moves visually convey rejection and approval. The meme's strength lies in its simple, instantly understandable two-panel structure that humorously illustrates contrasting preferences or attitudes. It has become a cultural staple due to its versatility and the internet's ease of remixing it to fit countless contexts—from simple personal likes and dislikes to social commentary. Drake himself has embraced the meme’s popularity, understanding how the meme helped cement his cultural presence beyond music. Ultimately, the meme transmits humor through relatable comparisons and showcases how internet culture can take a pop media moment and transform it into a shared form of expression and communication[2][3][6].
