It appears that there are no statements or sources provided for the description of the "Surprised Pikachu" meme. Therefore, I can't generate a comprehensive, cited answer based on specific evidence.

However, I can provide a brief overview of the meme's general context. 

The "Surprised Pikachu" meme features a screen capture of the Pokémon character Pikachu, looking shocked or surprised. The image originates from the animated Pokémon series, specifically from an episode aired in 1997. The meme typically accompanies captions that illustrate a scenario where a person experiences a surprising or unexpected consequence of their actions, often highlighting irony or obliviousness. As such, it serves as a humorous way to emphasize situations where someone should have seen the outcome coming.

If you have specific statements or sources you'd like me to analyze or if you would like to provide additional context, please do so, and I can help further!
