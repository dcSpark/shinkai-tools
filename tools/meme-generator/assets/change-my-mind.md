# Name: Change My Mind

## General Context:
The "Change My Mind" meme originated from a photograph of conservative podcaster Steven Crowder sitting at a table on a college campus, with a large sign reading "Male Privilege is a myth / Change My Mind." This image was posted on Twitter in February 2018 as part of Crowder's attempt to engage passersby in debates. The photograph quickly became an exploitable meme template, with internet users substituting the text on the sign to create humorous or satirical statements. Over time, the meme has diverged from its political origins to include a wide range of topics from pop culture to absurd and comedic claims[5][6].

## Usage:
* Box 1 (Top text on the sign): This space is for the main statement or controversial opinion that the meme creator wants to present. It is usually a bold, debatable, or ironic claim designed to provoke thought or amusement.
* Box 2 (Bottom text on the sign): This always reads "Change My Mind," inviting others to debate or dispute the statement above.
  
The man seated behind the sign is part of the meme’s visual context, lending a mock-serious tone as if awaiting persuasion.

## Examples:
* "The clitoris is a myth / Change my mind" – A humorous and absurd statement used to generate laughs through shock value[5].
* "Traps are not gay / Change my mind" – A contentious statement from fandom or internet subcultures, sparking debates within community contexts[5][6].
* "Gonna drink this mug of Hot Piss / Change my mind" – A deliberately ridiculous claim to entertain viewers with absurdity[5].
* Pop culture variations using characters like Anakin Skywalker, Luigi, or Snape with related fandom opinions or jokes[6].
* Merged with other memes, e.g., combined with the “This Is Fine” meme or the “Distracted Boyfriend” meme for layered humor[1].
  
## Summary:
The "Change My Mind" meme is a versatile internet format that originated from a politically charged photo but quickly evolved into a wide-ranging template for expressing opinions, humorous takes, or ironic statements. It functions by presenting a provocative or absurd claim on an iconic sign and challenges the audience to "change the creator’s mind," which is often more rhetorical than genuine. The meme transmits a playful invitation to debate or dispute, while mostly serving as a vehicle for humor, satire, or fandom commentary rather than serious discourse. Its widespread use and adaptability have made it emblematic of internet meme culture's tendency to repurpose political content into entertaining, often apolitical, social commentary[1][5][6].
