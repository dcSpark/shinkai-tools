# Name: Who Killed Hannibal

## General Context:
The "Who Killed Hannibal" meme originated from a 2013 skit on *The Eric Andre Show*. In the scene, Eric Andre (dressed in a suit) shoots co-host Hannibal Buress multiple times, then turns to the camera and asks, "Who killed Hannibal?" This surreal and humorous moment was later modified into a meme format, where the dialogue is often replaced with variations of "Why would X do Y?" to highlight irony or hypocrisy[6][7].

## Usage:
This meme typically uses three boxes:
- **Box 1**: Identify or describe the character or entity performing an action.
- **Box 2**: Label or describe the action being performed.
- **Box 3**: Modify the dialogue to say something like "Why would X do Y?" to emphasize irony or unexpected behavior[6][2].

## Examples:
- **Example 1**: Box 1 says "Self," Box 2 says "ignores friend's messages," and Box 3 says "Why would self expect to hear back?" This example pokes fun at self-inflicted problems.
- **Example 2**: Box 1 says " Politician," Box 2 says "promises transparency," and Box 3 says "Why would politician expect trust?" This example critiques political hypocrisy.
- **Example 3**: Box 1 says "Gamer," Box 2 says "spends all night gaming," and Box 3 says "Why would gamer complain about lack of sleep?" This example highlights the humor in personal contradictions.

## Summary:
The "Who Killed Hannibal" meme uses a dramatic scene to point out irony and hypocrisy. It juxtaposes actions with unexpected or unrelated dialogue, focusing on the theme that problems are often self-caused. This meme reflects on modern dilemmas by humorously highlighting contradictions in personal behavior or societal expectations. It gained popularity in 2018 as an exploitable meme format, allowing users to creatively apply it to various contexts to express frustration or humor at the absurdity of everyday situations[6][4].
