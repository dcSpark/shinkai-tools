# Name: Disappointed Black Guy
## General Context:
The "Disappointed Black Guy" meme is a reaction image macro that originated on Tumblr in 2011. It typically features two images of Ted Dorfeuille, a developer and artist, showing excitement followed by disappointment, symbolizing the contrast between expectation and reality. The meme spread widely after its inception and has remained popular across various social media platforms[1][2][3].

## Usage:
- **Box 1 (Expectation):** This box should contain text or an image depicting something desirable or anticipated. For example, a description of a fantastic vacation or a picture of a high-end item.
- **Box 2 (Reality):** This box is used to reveal the unexpected and usually disappointing reality. For instance, it could show a crowded and dirty beach if the expectation was a luxurious vacation, or a low-quality item if the expectation was something premium.

## Examples:
- **Example 1:** Expectation (Box 1): "Eating at a Michelin-starred restaurant." Reality (Box 2): "Eating at McDonald's."
- **Example 2:** Expectation (Box 1): "Expecting a beach day with clear skies." Reality (Box 2): "It's raining."
- **Example 3:** Expectation (Box 1): "Anticipating a brand-new video game." Reality (Box 2): "It's delayed again."

## Summary:
The "Disappointed Black Guy" meme is primarily used to convey the disparity between expectation and reality, often highlighting situations where the outcome is significantly less satisfying than what was anticipated. It is widely used across various contexts, whether personal, social, or humorous, to express a common feeling of disappointment. The meme's enduring popularity stems from its relatability and versatility in expressing letdowns in both real and fictional scenarios[1][5].
