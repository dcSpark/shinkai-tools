## General Context:
The "Buff Doge vs. Cheems" meme is a variation of the "Swole Doge vs. Cheems" format, which gained popularity in mid-2020 on platforms like Reddit and Facebook. It typically contrasts two eras or states, using a muscular, anthropomorphic Doge (often depicted as "buff" or "swole") to represent past virtues or achievements, and a less robust Cheems to symbolize the perceived shortcomings of the present. This meme is used to humorously highlight differences between historical or cultural eras, often focusing on generational changes and societal shifts[1][3][5].
