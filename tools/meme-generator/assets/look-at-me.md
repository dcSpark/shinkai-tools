# Name: Look At Me, I'm The Captain Now

## General Context:
"Look At Me, I'm The Captain Now" is a meme originating from a 2013 scene in the movie *Captain Phillips*, where Somali pirate leader Abduwali Muse (played by Barkhad Abdi) takes control of an American cargo ship and declares, "Look at me. I'm the captain now." The phrase and image are used online to signify a takeover or major change in control, often humorously or satirically portraying someone assuming authority or dominance unexpectedly[1][6].

## Usage:
* Box 1: Usually contains the perspective or role being taken over or replaced (e.g., the original leader or owner, or the old status quo).
* Box 2: Contains the phrase "Look At Me, I'm The Captain Now," representing the new party asserting control or dominance.

The meme typically has 2 text boxes: one for the prior controller or situation, the other for the imposing new "captain" asserting control[1][7].

## Examples:
* Political Takeover: The original leader or party is in box 1, and box 2 shows a new politician or faction saying "Look at me, I'm the captain now," to symbolize a power shift or election victory.
* Brand or Product Replacement: Box 1 might name an old popular product, and box 2 would show a new product or trend taking over consumer attention.
* Social or Cultural Change: Box 1 references an older social trend or practice, and box 2 features the emergent one taking precedence.
* Humorous Personal Situations: For example, box 1 could be "My old phone," and box 2 "My new phone," implying the new device now "rules."
* Pop Culture References: Variants with other "captain" figures like "Captain America" or parodies mixing the scene with other media characters have appeared[1][6].

## Summary:
The "Look At Me, I'm The Captain Now" meme captures the moment of sudden and definitive transfer of power or control from one entity to another.
