# Name: Monkey Puppet (Awkward Look Monkey)
## General Context:
The Monkey Puppet meme, known for its awkward side-eye expression, originates from the Japanese childrenâ€™s show *ÅŒkiku naru Ko* (1959â€“1988), where the character Kento (called "Pedro" in Latin America) became a reaction image staple[4][8]. It gained viral status around 2016 through clips and GIFs, often used to convey discomfort, feigned ignorance, or sarcastic surprise in awkward situations[2][6].

## Usage:
* **Box 1**: The initial setup or scenario (e.g., "When someone asks who ate the last slice of pizza").
* **Box 2**: The monkey puppetâ€™s reaction, either as a side-eye glance or a surprised look (often used as a reaction image/GIF)[5][6].

## Examples:
* **Workplace avoidance**: "Me pretending I didnâ€™t hear my boss ask about the overdue report" followed by Kentoâ€™s side-eye[3][6].
* **Social awkwardness**: "When you run into someone you said you were too busy to meet" paired with the surprised puppet face[3].
* **Brand humor**: Xbox used the meme to acknowledge a console leak, captioning it with "ðŸ‘€ Letâ€™s make it officialâ€¦"[6].
* **Everyday guilt**: "When your roommate asks who forgot to take out the trash" with the puppetâ€™s nervous glance[3].

## Summary:
The **Awkward Look Monkey Puppet** meme epitomizes the universal experience of discomfort or guilt in social interactions. Its two-panel format typically contrasts an awkward scenario with the puppetâ€™s iconic reactionâ€”either a sidelong glance to feign ignorance or a surprised expression for sarcastic emphasis[2][3][6]. By anthropomorphizing relatable moments of social faux pas, the meme humorously validates the impulse to avoid confrontation or awkwardness, making it a enduring tool for online self-deprecation and relatable humor. Its versatility ensures relevance across languages and cultures, particularly in meme formats emphasizing POV-style relatability[2][5].
