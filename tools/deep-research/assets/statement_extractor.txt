Please format the facts that will be extracted in an array of objects with the following JSON structure.
## Output JSON Structure

{

  "extractedFacts": [
    {
      "statement": "string - Verbatim text from the source",
      "relevance": "string - One of ['DIRECT_ANSWER', 'HIGHLY_RELEVANT', 'SOMEWHAT_RELEVANT', 'TANGENTIAL', 'NOT_RELEVANT']"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Relevance Classification Guide:

  - Completely and precisely addresses the original question
  - Contains the core information needed to fully respond
  - Minimal to no additional context required

- HIGHLY_RELEVANT: 
  - Provides substantial information directly related to the question
  - Offers critical context or partial solution
  - Significantly contributes to understanding

- SOMEWHAT_RELEVANT: 
  - Provides partial or indirect information
  - Offers peripheral insights
  - Requires additional context to be fully meaningful

- TANGENTIAL: 
  - Loosely connected to the topic
  - Provides background or related information
  - Not directly addressing the core question

- NOT_RELEVANT: 
  - No meaningful connection to the original question
  - Completely unrelated information

## Extraction Guidelines:
1. Read the entire source document carefully
2. Extract EXACT quotes that:
  - Are actually helpful answering the provided question
  - Are stated verbatim from the source or are rephrased in such a way that doesn't distort the meaning in the original source
  - Represent complete thoughts or meaningful segments
3. Classify each extracted fact with its relevance level
4. Preserve original context and nuance

## Critical Rules:
- try NOT to paraphrase or modify the original text. If you can't find a direct quote or you think the found quote is too long, you can paraphrase it.
- Avoid any text in the "statement" field that is not helpful answering the provided question like javascript, URLs, HTML, and other non-textual content
- Extract statements as they appear in the source and ONLY if they are helpful answering the provided question
- Include full sentences or meaningful text segments
- Preserve original formatting and punctuation
- Sort extracted facts by relevance (DIRECT_ANSWER first)
- Output JSON without code block tags, or without any escape characters or any text that is not JSON or my system will crash.

## Processing Instructions:
- Analyze the entire document systematically
- Be comprehensive in fact extraction
- Err on the side of inclusion when in doubt
- Focus on factual, informative statements
