# Name: Domino Effect
## General Context:
The **Domino Effect** meme is derived from the idea of a chain reaction where small actions lead to larger, sometimes unexpected consequences. It often features a series of dominoes, each one larger than the last, symbolizing how small events can escalate into significant outcomes. The meme typically uses a visual format showing a man pushing the first domino, with subsequent dominoes getting larger, adding a humorous or satirical twist to how simple actions can lead to more substantial effects[1][2].

## Usage:
- **Box 1**: The first box usually contains the initial action or event that sets off the chain reaction. It could be something as simple as "I hit the snooze button."
- **Box 2**: The second box explains the subsequent, larger consequence resulting from the initial action. For example, "I oversleep," "I'm late for work," etc.

## Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  - Box 1: "I check my phone before bed."
  - Box 2: "I end up scrolling through social media until 2 AM."
  
- **Example 2**:
  - Box 1: "I decide to skip breakfast."
  - Box 2: "I end up buying a expensive lunch."

- **Example 3**:
  - Box 1: "I watch one episode of a show."
  - Box 2: "I binge-watch the entire season in one sitting."

## Summary:
The **Domino Effect** meme highlights how small initial events can lead to larger consequences, often humorously or ironically portraying how such a chain of events unfolds. It serves as a metaphor for the idea that even minor actions can have significant effects over time, making it a versatile tool for expressing a variety of situations in a humorous or satirical manner[1][2]. The meme also underscores the concept of a "slippery slope," where one decision leads to another, potentially spiraling out of control. It's widely used across social media platforms to depict both positive and negative outcomes arising from simple beginnings[2][3].
