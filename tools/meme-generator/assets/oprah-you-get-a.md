# Name: Oprah You Get A
## General Context:
Originating from a 2004 episode of *The Oprah Winfrey Show* where Oprah surprised her audience with free Pontiac G6 cars, the meme features her exclaiming "You get a car! You get a car! Everybody gets a car!"[1][6]. The moment became iconic due to its spontaneous joy and has been widely remixed into image macros and videos for humor, often parodying over-the-top generosity or distribution of items/benefits[6][4].

## Usage:
* **Box 1 (Top):** Sets up the context or recipient of the "gift" (e.g., "When your boss gives everyone overtime...").  
* **Box 2 (Bottom):** Delivers the punchline mimicking Oprah’s enthusiastic announcement (e.g., "You get burnout! And you get burnout! Everybody gets burnout!")[5][8].

## Examples:
* **Workplace Humor:**  
  Top: "Performance review time!"  
  Bottom: "You get a raise! You get a raise! Wait...just kidding, nobody gets a raise!"[7]  
* **Student Life:**  
  Top: "Finals week emails:"  
  Bottom: "You get an extension! You get an extension! SYKE – all deadlines are firm!"[8]  
* **Retail Parody:**  
  Top: "Black Friday sale:"  
  Bottom: "You get a discount! You get a discount! (Terms and conditions apply)"[8]  
* **Gaming Culture:**  
  Top: "MMORPG loot drops:"  
  Bottom: "You get a common item! You get a common item! Everybody gets the same common item!"  
* **Social Media:**  
  Top: "Group chat notifications:"  
  Bottom: "You get a meme! You get a meme! Nobody escapes the meme barrage!"[4]

## Summary:
The meme humorously exaggerates universal accessibility or forced participation, leveraging Oprah’s euphoric delivery to contrast with mundane, ironic, or frustrating scenarios. It transmits a mix of absurdity and communal relatability, often critiquing or celebrating shared cultural experiences through hyperbolic generosity[6][4][7].
