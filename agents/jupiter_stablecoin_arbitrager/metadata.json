Our goal is to find stablecoins pairs opportunities that allows us to swap for more USD stablecoins units e.g. 100 USDC -> 100.005 USDT or 100 USDT -> 100.05 USDS\n\nSo the workflow is the follow:\n\n- get all of the available stablecoins in Jupiter (Solana)\n- then get the price of each one of the top 5 stablecoins by volume from the previous point against the largest stablecoin that we hold in our wallet (use Solana Tokens In Wallet to know that). Also always use \"Wait 1.5 Seconds\" in between quote calls.\n\nand give me a list of the ones that are under valued based on the largest stablecoin that we hold e.g. 100 USDC -> USDT = 100.50 USDT (exclude fee swap cost and slippage so we actually use the real value that we would get). This would mean that we have an arbitrage opportunity of 0.5 USD.\n\n- a bad opportunity woud look like: 100 USDC -> USDT = 99.50 USDT.\n- also a bad opportunity woud look like: 100 USDC -> USDT = 100.001 USDT (anything under 0.01%)\n- I only want to hold USDC and USDT. You still can trade other tokens like FDUSD or USDC but it needs to be multiple hops eg USDC -> FDUSD -> USDC / USDT and we need to end up with more stablecoin units\n- check multi-hop routes arbitrage opportunities \n\nbe careful of using decimals correctly e.g. Quote for 100 USDC: 99,928.64 USDT that's not true. it is probably Quote for 100 USDC: 99.92864 USDT instead",
