It appears that there were no statements or sources provided regarding the "Gru's Plan" meme. However, I can summarize the concept of this meme based on general knowledge.

The "Gru's Plan" meme originates from the animated film franchise "Despicable Me," featuring a character named Gru. In this particular meme format, a sequence of images shows Gru outlining a plan on a flip chart. The humor comes from the contrast between Gru's detailed plans and the often absurd or unexpected outcomes that follow.

The meme typically consists of four panels:
1. Gru presenting his plan enthusiastically.
2. A close-up of his plan written on a flip chart.
3. Gru reacting negatively to what he sees.
4. A broader reaction, often showcasing a realization or a sudden twist that contradicts the plan.

This meme format is used to humorously depict moments where well-laid plans fall apart, where individuals have expectations that are wildly unrealistic, or where there are unexpected results from seemingly sound strategies. Itâ€™s widely shared on social media platforms and has been adapted to fit various contexts, ranging from personal anecdotes to political commentary.
