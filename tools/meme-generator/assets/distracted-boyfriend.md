# Name: Distracted Boyfriend

## General Context:
The "Distracted Boyfriend" meme originates from a 2015 stock photograph taken by Spanish photographer Antonio Guillem in Girona, Catalonia, Spain. The image features a man (the "boyfriend") walking with a woman (his "girlfriend") while looking back at another woman passing by, who remains oblivious to the situation. The girlfriend displays a disapproving or outraged look. This photo was originally intended to depict the concept of infidelity in a playful and fun way. The image went viral on social media starting in early 2017 and became widely popular in August 2017 as a humorous metaphor to represent various kinds of disloyalty or distraction in relationships or commitments[1][5][6].

## Usage:
* Box 1 (usually the leftmost box, over the girlfriend): Represents the original or current commitment, option, or focus—often something important or valued but being neglected.
* Box 2 (usually the center box, over the boyfriend): Represents the person or entity who is distracted or losing focus.
* Box 3 (usually the rightmost box, over the other woman): Represents the new, more appealing distraction or temptation that draws attention away from the original priority[1][3].

## Examples:
* Example 1: The boyfriend is labeled "Me," the girlfriend "My responsibilities," and the other woman "Video games," illustrating procrastination or distraction from duties.
* Example 2: The boyfriend represents a brand, the girlfriend an old product, and the other woman a new trend or competitor, depicting shifting consumer interest.
* Example 3: The boyfriend is "A student," the girlfriend "Studying for exams," and the other woman "Social media," highlighting temptation to avoid studying.
* Example 4: The meme is used in political contexts, where the boyfriend is a politician or voter, the girlfriend is the current policy or party, and the other woman is a new, enticing political idea or opponent.
* Example 5: Meta or self-referential memes where the meme itself or internet culture is the distraction from real-life priorities or issues[3][6].

## Summary:
The "Distracted Boyfriend" meme encapsulates a universal human experience of distraction and temptation, often humorously portraying the tension between commitment and fleeting allure. Its composition—a man blatantly looking at another woman while holding his partner's hand—creates a clear narrative ripe for metaphorical use. This meme transmits themes of disloyalty, shifting attention, and the allure of novelty or distraction. Its enduring popularity stems from its versatility, relatability, and visual clarity, serving both as a straightforward joke and a prompt for creative storytelling and cultural commentary. The image has sparked diverse interpretations and a fan-fiction-like expansion online, revealing how a single frame can unfold multiple layers of meaning and cultural reflection[1][3][6].
