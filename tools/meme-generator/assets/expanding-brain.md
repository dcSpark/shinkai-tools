# Name: Expanding Brain
## General Context:
The Expanding Brain meme, also known as the Galaxy Brain meme, involves a series of images showing differently sized brains, often used to humorously depict a progression from simple to increasingly complex ideas or situations. It is typically ironic, suggesting that the more absurd or unrealistic a concept becomes, the larger the brain required to understand it needs to be[1][5].

## Usage:
* **Box 1**: Typically includes a simple idea or action, accompanied by a small brain image.
* **Box 2**: Features a slightly more complex or abstract version of the idea from Box 1, with a slightly larger brain image.
* **Box 3**: Presents an even more elaborate or humorous iteration, with a larger brain.
* **Box 4**: Often concludes with the most absurd or complex version, depicted with the largest brain image, implying the need for significant intellectual capacity to comprehend[1][5].

## Examples:
* **Example 1**: Starting with "who," evolving to "whom," "whomst," and ending with "whomst'd," each step accompanied by increasingly larger brain images[6].
* **Example 2**: Beginning with "people who pee quietly," progressing to more ridiculous methods to avoid noise, such as peeing directly into the toilet water, with brain size increasing accordingly[6].
* **Example 3**: Political variations, such as comparing different political ideologies from simple to complex, using the expanding brain format to poke fun at political discourse[2].

## Summary:
The Expanding Brain meme is about highlighting the humor in perceived intellectual superiority or complexity, often through irony. It is used to mock the idea that more elaborate or absurd ideas require greater intelligence, serving as a playful commentary on how we perceive complexity and sophistication. The meme's versatility allows it to be applied to various subjects, from language and everyday behaviors to politics and technology[1][6].
