# Name: Two Buttons (also known as Daily Struggle)

## General Context:
The "Two Buttons" meme features a comic-style image of a man sweating nervously while faced with two red buttons, symbolizing a difficult or contradictory choice. The meme format originated to depict the tension and internal conflict people experience when forced to decide between two opposing or problematic options. It highlights dilemmas, contradictions, or hypocrisies humorously or satirically in various contexts[2][5][8].

## Usage:
* Box 1 (Top panel): Shows two red buttons side by side, each labeled with a different option, idea, or statement that often contradicts or conflicts.
* Box 2 (Bottom panel): Depicts a man (usually wearing a red shirt and white gloves) in visible distress, sweating and holding his head as he struggles to choose one of the buttons.
* Box 3 (Sometimes added): Can include captions or descriptive text to frame the meme’s context or the nature of the dilemma.

The meme's structure visually communicates the mental struggle of making a difficult choice, often when both options have significant drawbacks or ironic contradictions[1][2][5].

## Examples:
* A meme showing a person sweating while choosing between buttons labeled “The Armenian Genocide is a lie” and “The Armenians were terrorists that deserved it,” used to criticize denialism and contradictory justifications related to the Armenian Genocide[1][4][7].
* Another version features the character debating between two conflicting social or political beliefs, such as “People can be born as the wrong gender” vs. “Gender is a social construct,” highlighting tensions around gender identity debates[2].
* Variants depict ideological contradictions, for example a “proud liberal” sweating over buttons labeled “cops are evil and racist” and “you don’t need a gun because you have police,” to emphasize conflicting viewpoints within political discourse[2].
* Some creative takes show the character pressing both buttons at once, or giving a thumbs-up after reluctantly accepting the problematic choice, adding humor on indecision[2].
* Everyday relatable dilemmas like “Eat healthy” vs. “Order pizza,” or “Go to sleep early” vs. “Stay up late scrolling,” showcase the meme’s flexibility in capturing human hesitation and internal conflict[5][6].

## Summary:
