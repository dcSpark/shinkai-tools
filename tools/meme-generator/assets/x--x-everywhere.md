# Name: X, X Everywhere

## General Context:
The "X, X Everywhere" meme originates from a famous scene in *Toy Story 2*, where Buzz Lightyear points out something ubiquitous to Woody. It started gaining meme usage around 2007 on the 420chan imageboard, initially with the phrase "DICKS EVERYWHERE" to curb spam, and quickly evolved into a versatile template used to express the overwhelming presence or abundance of something in diverse contexts. The phrase itself traces rhetorical roots back to the 18th-century poem *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner* by Samuel Taylor Coleridge ("Water, water, everywhere..."), emphasizing the theme of something being everywhere yet sometimes unwanted or problematic[1].

## Usage:
* Box 1: The first box typically contains the subject or thing that is perceived as being abundant or ubiquitous (e.g., a specific trend, item, or issue).
* Box 2: The second box completes the phrase with "X Everywhere," amplifying the feeling of saturation or excess of the subject described in the first box.

## Examples:
* "Memes, memes everywhere" — highlighting the oversaturation of memes on social media.
* "Ads, ads everywhere" — commenting on the overwhelming number of advertisements online.
* "Spam, spam everywhere" — expressing frustration with spam messages flooding inboxes or platforms.
* "Errors, errors everywhere" — used by programmers or users facing widespread bugs or technical issues.
* "Chill guys, chill guys everywhere" — adapted to viral trends or characters/ideas spreading rapidly across communities.
* "Plastic, plastic everywhere" — a commentary on environmental pollution.
These examples demonstrate how the meme can be used both humorously and critically to highlight anything perceived as excessive or inescapable[1][3][5].

## Summary:
The "X, X Everywhere" meme is a widely recognized cultural template that visually and textually conveys the idea of something being overwhelmingly present or pervasive. By portraying Buzz Lightyear gesturing expansively and Woody’s bewildered expression, it captures a mix of surprise, complaint, or awe at the ubiquity of whatever "X" represents. Its flexible format allows it to be deployed across countless contexts—from pop culture phenomena and internet trends to frustrations with daily annoyances—making it a versatile tool for social commentary and humor. Fundamentally, the meme transmits the feeling that a particular thing has saturated the environment to a noteworthy degree, often with a tone ranging from playful exaggeration to critical observation[1][3][5][6].
