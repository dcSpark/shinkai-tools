# Name: Running Away Balloon

## General Context:
The "Running Away Balloon" meme is a two-panel exploitable webcomic featuring a grey character trying to reach a yellow balloon, which represents a desired goal or opportunity, while a pink character holds the grey character back, preventing them from reaching the balloon. It is used to visually depict frustrations and situations where a person wants something but is held back by external or internal limitations. The meme originated on April 21, 2017, when Facebook user and webcomic artist Superlmer shared the original comic where the balloon symbolized "opportunities" and the pink character symbolized "shyness" holding the grey character back[1][2].

## Usage:

* Box 1 (Grey character): The person or entity striving or wanting something.
* Box 2 (Yellow balloon): The object, goal, or aspiration desired by the grey character.
* Box 3 (Pink character): The obstacle, limitation, or force that prevents the grey character from reaching the balloon.
* Boxes 4 and 5: Usually used for additional commentary or labels expanding on the struggle or providing humorous or relatable context.

The meme template is typically labeled to show contrasting concepts like "me" (grey character), "my dreams" (yellow balloon), and "my limitations" (pink character) holding one back[1][4].

## Examples:

* Original example: Balloon labeled "opportunities," pink figure labeled "shyness," representing how shyness prevents someone from seizing opportunities[1].
* A variation where the balloon is labeled "beautiful girls" and the pink figure labeled "my face, my luck, my empty pockets," humorously showing the obstacles to approaching attractive people[1].
* Another showing the balloon as "sleep" and the pink figure as "plans to go to bed early," portraying how plans to sleep early are thwarted[1][2].
* Meme depicting the balloon as "video games" and the pink figure as "girlfriend dragging me shopping," indicating distractions preventing leisure[2].
* Meme about balancing life and work, where the balloon is "personal time" and the pink figure is "overtime hours," illustrating obstacles to work-life balance[2].

## Summary:
The "Running Away Balloon" meme visually encapsulates the universal feeling of striving for something desirable but being impeded by barriers—be they personal traits, external circumstances, or unforeseen distractions. It resonates due to its simple but relatable portrayal of the struggle between aspirations and limitations. The grey character's relentless reach toward a floating balloon, continuously held back by the pink figure, symbolizes the tension between desire and restraint. The meme’s flexibility allows it to be used humorously or poignantly across various contexts where goals feel just out of reach due to various hindrances, making it a popular and enduring format for expressing frustration and the human condition of grappling with obstacles[1][2][4].
