# Name: Say the Line, Bart! (Simpsons)

## General Context:
"Say the Line, Bart!" is a meme originating from a three-panel scene in *The Simpsons* episode titled "Bart Gets Famous" (Season 5, Episode 12), which originally aired on February 3, 1994[1][4]. In this scene, Bart Simpson becomes famous for his catchphrase "I didn't do it," which he weakly delivers when prompted by his classmates, led by Milhouse, who repeatedly ask him to "say the line." After Bart says it, his classmates cheer enthusiastically. The meme format uses this setup to replace Bart’s catchphrase with other lines, often humorous or culturally relevant ones, while the classmates expectantly wait and then celebrate.

## Usage:
The meme is structured as a three-panel comic, corresponding to the box_count of 3:

* **Box 1:** Classmates (including Milhouse) looking expectantly at Bart, usually with a caption prompting him to "say the line" or equivalent.
* **Box 2:** Bart dejectedly or reluctantly saying the line, which is the catchphrase or phrase being parodied or highlighted.
* **Box 3:** Classmates erupting in applause or cheering, celebrating the line said by Bart.

This formula is exploited by changing the line Bart says to various phrases or catchphrases for comedic or ironic effect.

## Examples:
* Bart saying the original line: "I didn't do it."
* Bart saying "Fuck Her Right In The Pussy," a popular viral phrase[1].
* Bart saying "Say the Line, Winrar," referencing the WinRAR software and its memes around it[1].
* Bart delivering a popular joke or catchphrase from a subculture, such as gaming, internet slang, or TV shows[1].
* Bart saying lines from other memes, such as Steamed Hams or other Simpsons memes[1].
* Custom variations where Bart's line highlights a funny or unexpected punchline, often to call out overused jokes or lines[6].

## Summary:
The "Say the Line, Bart!" meme captures the comedic and cultural idea of being pigeonholed into a single catchphrase or joke, reflecting Bart Simpson's brief stint as a one-trick celebrity in "Bart Gets Famous." It humorously highlights how some catchphrases gain viral popularity and become repetitive or expected, with Bart reluctantly performing under peer pressure, while others cheer on the familiarity. Online, the meme is a versatile template for parody and social commentary, used to mock, celebrate, or simply share notable lines from various contexts. It conveys a sense of humorous ritual expectation followed by exaggerated approval, often used to poke fun at internet culture’s obsession with catchphrases and memes[1][4][6].
