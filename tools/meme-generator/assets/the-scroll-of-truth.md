# Name: The Scroll Of Truth
## General Context:
The **Scroll of Truth** meme is derived from a webcomic by artist Tate Parker. It features an explorer who, after a long search, finds a scroll containing an unpleasant or unsettling truth. Upon reading it, he becomes disgusted and throws the scroll away, shouting "Nyehhh!" The meme is highly exploitable, allowing users to replace the original text with their own humorous or satirical truths[3][6].

## Usage:
* **Box 1:** Typically used to set up the scenario or context, often explaining what the explorer is searching for or expecting to find.
* **Box 2:** Contains the text of the scroll, usually revealing a humorous, uncomfortable, or ironic truth that surprises or disgusts the explorer.

## Examples:
* **Example 1:** The explorer finds a scroll that says, "You will never be able to cook without burning it." This could be used to poke fun at someone's culinary skills.
* **Example 2:** A version of the meme might say, "The best pizza topping is pineapple." This could be humorous to those who strongly disagree with such an opinion.
* **Example 3:** Another example could be, "Some of your problems are your own fault," used in self-deprecation or social commentary.

## Summary:
The **Scroll of Truth** meme is about revealing unexpected, often uncomfortable truths in a humorous or ironic way. It allows users to comment on various topics, from everyday life challenges to social issues or pop culture phenomena. The meme serves as a vehicle for expressing disbelief, discomfort, or surprise at a perceived truth, making it versatile for both personal reflection and social commentary[3][6].
