The "Drake Blank" meme, also known as the "Drakeposting" meme, originated from a scene in the music video for Drake's song "Hotline Bling." In the meme, there are two panels featuring the Canadian rapper Drake. The first panel shows him rejecting something with a disapproving expression, while the second panel shows him approving of something with a pleased expression. This format is typically used to convey contrasting opinions or preferences about a subject.
