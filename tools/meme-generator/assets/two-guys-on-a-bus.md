# Name: Two Guys on a Bus  
## General Context:  
The meme features two men seated opposite each other on a bus, one viewing a bleak rock wall (sad/negative) and the other a scenic landscape (happy/positive). Originally created in 2013 by Brazilian artist Genildo Ronchi as an inspirational cartoon titled *"Choose the Happy Side of Life"*, it gained meme status in 2019 through Brazilian Twitter before going global in 2021[1][3][6].  

## Usage:  
* **Box 1**: Left-side text describing the negative perspective (e.g., "Forgetting to charge your phone").  
* **Box 2**: Right-side text describing the positive perspective (e.g., "10% battery lasts all day").  

## Examples:  
* **Persistence**:  
  * Left: *"Gave up after one rejection"*  
  * Right: *"Sent 100 job applications"*[3][6]  
* **Gaming**:  
  * Left: *"Playing Elden Ring blind"*  
  * Right: *"Using a walkthrough for every boss"*[3]  
* **Social Media**:  
  * Left: *"Posts cringe"*  
  * Right: *"Embraces cringe"*[3][6]  
* **2021 Reddit Example**:  
  * Left: *"Taking a shit at home"*  
  * Right: *"Taking a shit before leaving the house"*[2]  
* **2024 Twitter Variant**:  
  * Left: *"Asking 'What game is this?'"*  
  * Right: *"Still asking 'What game is this?'"*[3]  

## Summary:  
The meme juxtaposes contrasting attitudes or outcomes, often highlighting trivial or relatable life choices. It visually reinforces the idea that perspective shapes experienceâ€”whether humorously trivializing first-world problems or satirizing perseverance. While originally an uplifting message, its internet adaptation leans into absurdist humor to emphasize polarizing viewpoints or mundane dilemmas[1][3][6].
