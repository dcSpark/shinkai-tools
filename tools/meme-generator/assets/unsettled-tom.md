# Name: Unsettled Tom

## General Context:
The "Unsettled Tom" meme features a distinctive image of Tom, the iconic cat from the classic cartoon *Tom and Jerry*, looking alarmed, anxious, or disturbed. This meme originated from a 2012 comic series titled *Tails Gets Trolled*, in which Tom exhibits a stressed expression. It gained traction as a reaction image on platforms like 4chan and Reddit starting around 2013 and saw a surge in popularity around early 2019. The meme is often used to depict feelings of discomfort, shock, or being caught off guard by an unsettling or inappropriate revelation[1][2][6].

## Usage:
* Box 1: A seemingly innocuous or benign statement, premise, or setup that creates a calm or neutral expectation.
* Box 2: A shocking, unsettling, or disturbing twist that reveals the darker, inappropriate, or surprising nature of what was first implied, paired with the image of Tom’s disturbed expression.

The meme relies on the dramatic contrast between the top caption’s tone and the bottom caption’s revelation, with Tom’s anxious face visually representing the viewer’s unsettled reaction[2][3].

## Examples:
* Example 1:  
  - Box 1: "When you realize your favorite snack tastes great"  
  - Box 2: "But it’s been expired for two years"  
  (Tom’s face represents the grossed-out, worried feeling upon this realization.)

* Example 2:  
  - Box 1: "He said he loves all kinds of music"  
  - Box 2: "But only listens to elevator jazz"  
  (Showing disappointment and confusion.)

* Example 3:  
  - Box 1: "Our family dinners are always happy"  
  - Box 2: "Until someone brings up politics"  
  (Highlighting the sudden tension and discomfort.)

* Example 4:  
  - Box 1: "I thought the job interview went well"  
  - Box 2: "But they asked for my social security number right away"  
  (Portraying suspicion and alarm.)

These examples illustrate how the meme is broadly adaptable for expressing surprise, discomfort, or second thoughts triggered by an unexpected or awkward situation[2][6].

## Summary:
The "Unsettled Tom" meme uses a highly expressive and anxious image of Tom the cat to visually communicate the feeling of unease or shock after encountering something unsettling. Its two-part text setup creates a contrast where a calm or positive statement is quickly undercut by a disturbing or ironic twist, causing a humorous but relatable "wait, what?" reaction. The meme effectively captures the universal human experience of being caught off guard emotionally or mentally, often in socially awkward or morally questionable contexts. It has been popularized as a versatile reaction meme that applies to politics, social situations, personal revelations, and everyday awkward moments, making it a widely recognized template for humorous but unsettling commentary[1][2][6].
