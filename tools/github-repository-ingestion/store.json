  "description": "Converts Git repositories (from URL) into structured text for LLM processing. Supports file include/exclude patterns. Optional export (MD, XML, TXT).\n\nNotes : Individual files larger than 10MB are skipped by default by the underlying gitingest library. Currently the 'include' option of the gitingest library does not recursively include nested directories."
