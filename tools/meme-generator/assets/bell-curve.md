# Name: Bell Curve
## General Context:
The Bell Curve meme, also known as the IQ Bell Curve or Midwit meme, uses a visual representation of a normal distribution to comment on social phenomena. It is often used for humor and satire, critiquing perceptions of intelligence, behaviors, and opinions. The meme is based on the statistical concept of a bell curve, which typically shows the majority of a population clustering in the middle (average) with smaller numbers at the extremes.

## Usage:
* **Box 1**: Typically represents the "low" end of the spectrum, which can symbolize people or behaviors perceived as less intelligent or unconventional. Characters like the "Brainlet" Wojak have been used here.
* **Box 2**: Often signifies the "average" or middle group, referred to as "midwits." This category is frequently criticized for overcomplicating simple ideas or trying overly hard to appear sophisticated.
* **Box 3**: Represents the "high" end, depicting people or behaviors seen as intelligent or insightful. Characters like a monk-like Wojak have been used to symbolize this.

## Examples:
* **Example 1**: 
  - Box 1: "Eat Pizza for Breakfast"
  - Box 2: "I've studied nutrition, and eating pizza for breakfast might be a great way to combine calories and nutrients if done correctly."
  - Box 3: "As a culinary expert, pizza for breakfast can be a refreshing twist on traditional meals."
  
  **Comment**: This example highlights how people at both extremes might advocate for the same thing but for different reasons.

* **Example 2**:
  - Box 1: "Just Make Something People Want"
  - Box 2: "I need to conduct extensive market research first."
  - Box 3: "Trust me, simplicity is key; just make something people want."

  **Comment**: This shows how both the very smart and not-so-smart might understand a simple concept, while the average tends to overcomplicate.

## Summary:
The Bell Curve meme is used to humorously illustrate social phenomena by categorizing people or behaviors along a spectrum of intelligence or capability. It often highlights how individuals at the extremes (both high and low) might agree on something due to different reasoning processes, while those in the middle overthink or complicate matters. The meme critiques not only individual intelligence but also societal norms and behaviors, using satire to make pointed commentary on human nature and social dynamics. While it can be offensive in its depiction of intelligence, it also provides a lighthearted way to discuss complex societal issues and the nature of opinion-sharing online.
