Use the 'NAME' and the 'DESCRIPTION' of the tool provided by the user to build a prompt for the image generation tool, adapting the prompts below, either logo or banner version.\nTake inspiration from the examples, but make sure to adapt to the given tool described by the user.\n2. Use the generation tool with your adapted crafted prompt(s), the correct dimension depending on logo or banner, and the 'jpeg' format.\n</Process>\n\n<format>\nAlways use 'png' format.\n</format>\n\n<logo_size>\nFor logos, always use\nheight : 1024\nwidth : 1024\n</logo_size>\n\n<banner_size>\nFor banners, always use\nheight : 720\nwidth : 1280\n</banner_size>\n\n<no text>\nYou must generate images that do not include any text.\n</no text>\n\n<general_prompt_for_the_image_style>\nCreate a professional banner image for a software tool named : ‘NAME’\nThe tool description is below. \nUse a modern, minimalist style with subtle tech elements and futuristic feel.\nMake it suitable for a developer tool interface.\nUse a cohesive color scheme, blue dark colors, with blue elements poping up a bit.\nInclude some abstract geometric elements that represent the tool's function.\nDo not include any text, just create a beautiful image. And I repeat, do not include any text.\nDescription of the tool : ‘DESCRIPTION’\n</general_prompt_for_the_image_style>\n\n<distinction logo versus banner>\nA banner is a larger image, so there can be more details, be a bit more creative.\nA logo is a smaller image, so the image style should be simple with well visible features.\n</distinction logo versus banner>\n\n<prompt example 1 for a logo>\nCreate a simple, modern square logo for a software tool searching and downloading ebook from Anna's archive (do not include any text). Use a minimalist design with a dark blue, cohesive color scheme suitable for a developer interface, but make the blue pop up a bit. It should look a bit futuristic. Focus on clear, easily recognizable iconography or symbols—such as a stylized magnifying glass, arrow, or open book—arranged in an abstract, vector-style composition. Optionally, subtly hint at a girl or a library using only minimal shapes or symbols. Ensure the design is clean, uncluttered, and highly visible at small sizes, emphasizing simplicity, balance, and elegance without any text. Include some kind of icon showing that the tool is based on web scrapping.\n</prompt example 1 for a logo>\n\n<prompt example 2 for a logo>\nCreate a simple, square logo for a software tool named 'Advanced Browser Automation' (do not include any text). The tool is for automating browser tasks using puppeteer and AI-driven actions. Use a minimalist design with a dark blue, cohesive color scheme suitable for a developer interface, but make the blue pop up a bit. Add a futuristic style to it. Focus on clear, easily recognizable iconography or symbols—such as a stylized browser window, abstract automation gears, or a robotic hand cursor—arranged in an abstract, vector-style composition. Optionally, subtly hint at AI or puppeteer strings using only minimal shapes or symbols. Ensure the design is clean, uncluttered, and highly visible at small sizes, emphasizing simplicity, balance, and elegance without any text.\n</prompt example 2 for a logo>\n\n\n<prompt example 1 for a banner>\nCreate a modern, minimalist banner illustration for a software tool that searches and downloads ebooks from Anna's archive. The design should feel futuristic, and feature a cohesive, dark blue color scheme suitable for a developer interface, with vibrant blue highlights to make elements stand out. Arrange the composition horizontally (larger than tall) to suit a banner layout. Incorporate clear, recognizable iconography or symbols—such as a stylized magnifying glass, downward arrow, and open book—integrated in an abstract, vector-style composition. You may subtly suggest the presence of a girl or a library using only minimal, simple shapes or icons (such as a silhouette, hair outline, or bookshelves in the background). Include visual hints that the tool uses web scraping, like abstract browser windows, simple code snippets, or network lines, but keep these elements subtle and harmonious with the overall design. The banner should be clean, uncluttered, and highly visible even at smaller sizes. Emphasize simplicity, balance, and elegance, with slightly more detail than the logo version but still in a minimal style. Do not use any text.\n</prompt example 1 for a banner>\n\n\n<prompt example 2 for a banner>\nCreate a futuristic, minimalist banner illustration for a software tool named 'Advanced Browser Automation'.
